Vector Search and Embedding Strategy

Semantic search is implemented using dense vector embeddings.
Each document is split into smaller text chunks before embedding.

Embeddings are generated using an external AI model optimized for semantic similarity.
The same embedding model is used for both document chunks and user queries to ensure
vector space compatibility.

Vector embeddings are stored in a vector database that supports cosine similarity.
During search, the system retrieves the top K most similar chunks based on vector distance.

Metadata such as document ID, project name, and chunk index are stored as payload
alongside each vector to enable filtering and traceability.
