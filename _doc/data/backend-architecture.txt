Backend Architecture Details

The backend is implemented in Java 25 using Spring Boot 4.
It follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns.

Controllers are responsible only for HTTP request handling and validation.
Business logic is implemented in service classes.
Persistence is handled through Spring Data JPA repositories.

The backend communicates with the vector database using a REST-based client.
Vector operations such as upsert and similarity search are abstracted behind a dedicated service.

Error handling follows a centralized exception handling strategy using
Spring's @ControllerAdvice mechanism.

The backend is designed to be stateless, enabling horizontal scaling
behind a load balancer.
