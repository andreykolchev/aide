System Architecture Overview

The system is designed as a modular, service-oriented backend focused on document ingestion,
semantic search, and AI-assisted question answering.

The architecture consists of three main layers: the API layer, the intelligence layer,
and the storage layer.

The API layer is implemented using Spring Boot 4 and exposes REST endpoints for document
upload, semantic search, and question answering.

The intelligence layer is responsible for text chunking, vector embedding generation,
similarity search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This layer integrates with
external Large Language Models through HTTP APIs.

The storage layer consists of two main components. Relational data such as document metadata
and text chunks are stored in PostgreSQL. Vector embeddings are stored in a dedicated vector
database optimized for similarity search.

All components are designed to be loosely coupled and horizontally scalable.
