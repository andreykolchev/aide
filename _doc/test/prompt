System Architecture Overview

The system is designed as a modular, service-oriented backend focused on document ingestion,
semantic search, and AI-assisted question answering.

The architecture consists of three main layers: the API layer, the intelligence layer,
and the storage layer.

The API layer is implemented using Spring Boot 3 and exposes REST endpoints for document
upload, semantic search, and question answering.

The intelligence layer is responsible for text chunking, vector embedding

designed to be loosely coupled and horizontally scalable.

Backend Architecture Details

The backend is implemented in Java 25 using Spring Boot 3.
It follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns.

Controllers are responsible only for HTTP request handling and validation.
Business logic is implemented in service classes.
Persistence is handled through Spring Data JPA repositories.

The backend communicates with the vector database using a REST-based client.
Vector operations such as upsert and similarity search are abstracted behind

is responsible for text chunking, vector embedding generation,
similarity search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This layer integrates with
external Large Language Models through HTTP APIs.

The storage layer consists of two main components. Relational data such as document metadata
and text chunks are stored in PostgreSQL. Vector embeddings are stored in a dedicated vector
database optimized for similarity search.

All components are designed to be loosely coupled and horizontally sc
