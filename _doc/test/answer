The system is designed as a modular, service-oriented backend focused on document ingestion, semantic search, and AI-assisted question answering.
It is implemented in Java 25 using Spring Boot 3 and follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns.
All components are designed to be loosely coupled and horizontally scalable.\n\nThe architecture consists of three main layers:

1.  **API Layer:**
Implemented using Spring Boot 3, it exposes REST endpoints for document upload, semantic search, and question answering.
Controllers in this layer are responsible for HTTP request handling and validation.

2.  **Intelligence Layer:**
This layer is responsible for text chunking, vector embedding generation, similarity search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
It integrates with external Large Language Models through HTTP APIs.
Business logic is implemented in service classes within this layer.

3.  **Storage Layer:**
This layer comprises two main components. Relational data, such as document metadata and text chunks, is stored in PostgreSQL.
Vector embeddings are stored in a dedicated vector database optimized for similarity search.
Persistence is handled through Spring Data JPA repositories, and the backend communicates with the vector database using a REST-based client.
